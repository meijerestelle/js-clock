# JS Clock

## Summary
Made a realtime clock using JS, which can alter from analog to digital.

## Approach
For this challenge there were a few principles I had to look up:

- How to fetch (date/)time;
- How to display said (date/)time;
- How to use a buttton + function to toggle between both clocks

## Reflection
Overall, the challenge went pretty solid. The resources for making this were plenty, so I could easily find the things that caused bugs (mostly it was my typing, LOL).

I tried not to 'understand' every single aspect of the code, even though that's usually something I'm very tempted to do. So I'm content with the fact that I managed to be okay with not trying this during this challenge.

Every project I do with a fixed, centered div in the middle of the page, doesn't come to me easily. Had to look it up for past challenges, but couldn't at all remember how to do it. So this one was a good exercise.

## Resources
- w3schools.com -> for general information about above topics, aswell as the canvas clock (because 'drawing' with JSisn't exactly my cup of tea).
